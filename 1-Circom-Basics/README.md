# ðŸ§  ZKP Full Practice Summary (Circom + SnarkJS Based)

---

## ðŸ“Œ Practice Goals

- Design Circom circuit and implement the entire ZKP flow directly using SnarkJS
- Link with Verifier in Solidity to perform ZK verification in smart contracts

---

## ðŸ”¸ Summary of ZKP Core Concepts

### âœ… What is ZKP (Zero-Knowledge Proof)?

- A method that **proves** only the **fact** of knowing the **private input** without directly disclosing any **secret information**
- Applications in various areas such as privacy protection, state proof, and L1-L2 bridge in blockchain

### âœ… 3 stages of Groth16-based ZKP

1. **Setup**

- Convert circuit (.circom) to R1CS format
- Generate common setting value (PTAU) + circuit-based ZKey file

2. **Prove**

- Generate witness with input (input.json)
- Generate proof based on witness + ZKey

3. **Verify**

- Verifier verifies proof and public input (public) to determine authenticity

## ðŸ”¸ Summary of command flow during practice

### âœ… Compile Circom circuit

```bash
circom circuits/WithdrawProof.circom --r1cs --wasm --sym -o build/
```

### âœ… Set Powers of Tau

```bash
snarkjs powersoftau new bn128 14 pot14_0000.ptau
snarkjs powersoftau contribute pot14_0000.ptau pot14_final.ptau --name="junseung"
snarkjs powersoftau prepare phase2 pot14_final.ptau pot14_final_phase2.ptau
```

### âœ… Generate zkey

```bash
snarkjs groth16 setup build/WithdrawProof.r1cs build/pot14_final_phase2.ptau build/withdrawproof_0000.zkey
snarkjs zkey contribute build/withdrawproof_0000.zkey build/withdrawproof_final.zkey --name="junseung"
snarkjs zkey export solidityverifier build/withdrawproof_final.zkey contracts/Verifier.sol
```

### âœ… Input and proof

```bash
snarkjs wtns calculate build/WithdrawProof.wasm inputs/withdraw_input.json build/witness.wtns
snarkjs groth16 prove build/withdrawproof_final.zkey build/witness.wtns proof/proof.json proof/public.json
```

### âœ… Verification

```bash
snarkjs zkey export verificationkey build/withdrawproof_final.zkey build/verification_key.json
snarkjs groth16 verify build/verification_key.json proof/public.json proof/proof.json
```

## ðŸ”¸ Key points that were often confused

- The internal array order of `pi_b` needs to be changed â†’ Adjusted to `[y, x]` â†’ `[x, y]`
- `public.json` only contains information that should be public among the `signal inputs` of the Circom circuit
- Solidity Verifier requires a **very strict format** such as `uint[2]`, `uint[2][2]`, `uint[4]`
- **Public input order** in `verifyProof()` must be 100% identical to the circuit definition

---

## âœ… What has been completed so far

- Circom circuit design and compilation
- Entire Powers of Tau ceremony process
- zkey, Solidity Verifier generation
- Witness and proof generation
- Off-chain verification using SnarkJS **OK**
- Hardhat integration and Solidity verification **Tracking the cause of failure**

---

## ðŸªœ Next activities Recommended

1. Regenerate `.zkey`, `.ptau`, `verifier.sol` (reset all configurations)
2. Regenerate ZK proof with new `withdraw_input.json`
3. Re-run Hardhat integration (`npx hardhat test`)
4. Practice extending Circom circuit (`withdraw_limit`, `range_check`, etc.)
5. Practice designing ZK-based authentication circuit (simple login, etc.)
