# üîê Zero-Knowledge Proof Practice Report

## üìò Overview: Purpose of this Practice

The purpose of this project is to experience the entire process from ZKP circuit design to proof generation and Solidity integration through ZKP (Zero-Knowledge Proof) practice based on Circom and snarkjs.

Through this, we will establish the foundation for practical design such as **ZKBridge, AKP, L2 Rollup, DID authentication structure design**.

## üß† Theoretical Background

### 1. Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP)

- **Prove to the other party that I satisfy a certain condition**, but hide the specific input of the condition. - Components:
- Circuit: Formula expresses the condition to be proven
- Input value: Separate public/private input
- Witness: Circuit execution result
- Proof: Mathematical proof created based on the data above

### 2. L1 ‚Üî L2 structure

- Layer 1 (L1): Main chain (ex. Ethereum)
- Layer 2 (L2): External network that processes transactions faster and cheaper
- **ZKP-based state proof** plays a key role when reflecting the state processed in L2 to L1

### 3. ZKBridge

- Bridge structure that proves and propagates the state between different blockchains (L1-L2 or cross-chain)
- Components:
- State tree (Merkle Root)
- ZKP circuit (Proof of validity of L2 state change)
- Verifier (L1 smart contract)

## üß© Key points I asked again during practice

- `.zkey` is a proof environment based on `.ptau` + `.r1cs`.
- `witness` is the result of internal circuit calculations and is the material for generating proof.
- `withdraw_input.json` contains both public and private values.
- `public.json` contains only values ‚Äã‚Äãexplicitly declared as `signal input public` in the circuit. - `verification_key` is extracted from `.zkey` to only verify the information needed for verification.
